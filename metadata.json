  "description": "Hey Gnome, it's bedtime! Converts to grayscale the entire Gnome workspace by using a smooth transition. \n\nThis behavior is similar to Android's bedtime mode which converts the phone screen to grayscale. It should somewhat make your device less appealing and limit the usage of it before bedtime. On my side, at least, it still requires a fair amount of self control in order to make that happen.\n\nYou can enable/disable the extension from command line:\ngnome-extensions enable gnomebedtime@ionutbortis.gmail.com\ngnome-extensions disable gnomebedtime@ionutbortis.gmail.com\n\nBy doing this you can schedule it nicely with crontab, your own scripts or some other extensions that support scheduling.",
